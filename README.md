# BattleShip

#### BattleShip is a C++ recreation of a board game, well, [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

## How to play

- Choose what to do: place a ship, or delete one.
- Enter the coordinates for the beginning and end of the ship. (first coordinate is Y-axis, second is X-axis)
- Place all the ships on the field.
- Confirm the placement.
- Start attacking!
 
> The game plays out just like the tabletop version.

```sh
The game might lag when loading the enemy ships. Just re-launch the program and it will fix it usually.
Compile the program with "g++ ship.cpp play.cpp" and run with "./a.exe" (or double click on a file)
```
